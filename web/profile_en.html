        <h2>Unleash Technological Power with Me!</h2>
        <p>
            Greetings, Tech Titans.
            <br>
            <br>
            I am a Computer Engineer and Business Intelligence Specialist.
            <br>
            <br>
            My goal is to seamlessly integrate into your technological tribe and take our company to new heights.
            <br>
            <br>
            Let me tell you more about my profile...
        </p>
    </section>

    <section id="skills">
        <h2>Technology Profile</h2>
        <p>
            In a world where data becomes a strategic resource, my profile stands out as a master behind the scenes, specializing in orchestrating and creating data warehouses as a Business Intelligence (BI) Engineer and unraveling concepts as a Data Analyst.
            <br>
            <br>
            My commitment extends beyond these skills, encompassing training in software programming. My focus is particularly on Java, where I apply the principles of Clean Architectures, Hexagonal Architecture, Onion Architecture, and the Model-View-Controller (MVC) pattern in software design. Additionally, I am immersed in an active learning phase in web development, exploring technologies like HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.
            <br>
            <br>
            All of this journey unfolds under agile methodologies like Scrum.
            <br>
            <br>
            In summary, my technology profile spans from strategic data management to the creation of quality software solutions, with a constant process of learning and adaptation in an ever-evolving technological environment.
